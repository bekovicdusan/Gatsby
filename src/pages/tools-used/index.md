### Previous versions

These links all go to the [Wayback Machine internet archive](https://web.archive.org/).

This site has been around since 2004. In the past it's been hosted as [armysteve.com](https://web.archive.org/web/2014*/http://armysteve.com) (when I was deployed to Iraq) and [stevesmithblog.com](https://web.archive.org/web/2014*/http://stevesmithblog.com). Before that, my "blog" was on [aspalliance.com](https://web.archive.org/web/19981201200150/http://www.aspalliance.com/stevesmith/) as far back as 1998 and my first online "home page" was my [University of Chicago student page circa 1992-94 or so](https://web.archive.org/web/19990224224552/http://student-www.uchicago.edu/users/sasmith/).

    "window.zoomLevel": 1,
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Light+",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

## Source Control

I'm a huge fan of Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/ardalis). I use VS Code or the CLI for most of my git needs. I have [a bunch of articles and tips related to git](https://www.google.com/search?q=git+site%3Aardalis.com) if you're looking for more info.

## Screencasting

I record online courses for [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/steve-smith) and occasional [screencasts on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ardalis?sub_confirmation=1). I use [TechSmith Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) to record and produce my screencasts and [TechSmith SnagIt](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) for screenshots. I also use [LiceCAP](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) for animated screen captures, which are useful for tweets and [emailed tips](/tips).

## Streaming

I'm currently streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ardalis) most Fridays, discussing developer topics. The streams are archived on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ardalis?sub_confirmation=1). My setup uses [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/). There's enough complexity there that I'll probably create a separate article just for the rest of the details, including how I've configured an [Elgato Stream Deck](https://amzn.to/2G7JtWy). I haven't gotten too fancy with my stream's interactivity - I mostly just focus on building open source tools with .NET, including [my various NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=ardalis).

## Laptop

In December 2019 I finally broke down and bought a new laptop. It's a 15″ Dell XPS with 1TB of storage and 32GB of RAM. So far it has only a few stickers; I'll post a pic at some point.

The MBP (below) is still going strong but will mainly stay at home now (it hasn't been used much since early 2020). Its MacOS calendar printing capabilities are worth keeping it around, if nothing else (we use many different Google calendars to manage our family of 6 and nothing else we've found can print out decent looking weekly/monthly calendars).

The Macbook is a Pro Retina 15″ circa 2013 (I purchased it in June 2014). It's running 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 and has 16GB 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM and an Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB graphics card. I run Parallels to run Windows on it and I switch back and forth between MacOS and Windows when developing. It's accumulated a few stickers over the years – here's a pic from September 2018:

## Desktop

I recently built a new Ultimate Developer Rig, [which I wrote about with benchmarks here](https://ardalis.com/ultimate-developer-rig-2019). You can view just the parts [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Ffjm9J). Here's a short summary:

* Core i9-9900K 3.6GHz 8-Core Processor
* Gigabyte Z390 AORUS MASTER ATX LGA1151 Motherboard
* 32 GB DDR4-3866 Memory
* 1TB M.2 SSD
* GeForce RTX 2080 8 GB Video Card

It's a beast I named NightKing.

I'm still running it as my main dev/game rig. I updated it to 64GB of RAM in 2021.

## Avatar

![](/img/steve-smith-ardalis-200x200.jpg)

Custom avatar by Nate Lovett

My avatar was created by [Nate Lovett](https://twitter.com/natelovett). I'm on the [Stir Trek](https://stirtrek.com) conference board and in 2016 we had Nate produce avatars for all of our speakers and board members. He did a great job, and if you'd like him to create one for you, contact him via twitter. I'm currently using this avatar on most of my social media and Slack channels, as well as the basis for my [Weekly Dev Tips podcast](http://weeklydevtips.com) logo.

[David Neal (@reverentgeek)](https://twitter.com/reverentgeek) also does some great custom-drawn avatars.

## Drawing

Speaking of David Neal, he turned me on to the great [Sketches Pro app for iOS](http://tayasui.com/sketches/). I'm using that along with an Apple Pencil and a relatively new iPad to create drawings for my blog posts, newsletters, and presentations. My drawing abilities are still pretty weak, but the app is very powerful and it's quite pleasant to use the combination. In the past, I'd tried drawing pads for the PC, but it's much easier to draw directly on the (portable) surface you're working with than to draw on the desk while looking at the screen, I found.

A few of my articles, including one of my most popular ones about [The More You Know, The More You Realize You Don't Know](https://ardalis.com/the-more-you-know-the-more-you-realize-you-dont-know/), use drawings I made using this setup.

## Podcast

My podcast, [Weekly Dev Tips](http://www.weeklydevtips.com/), is hosted by [Simplecast](https://simplecast.com/). I use a [Rode Podcaster microphone](http://amzn.to/2p2FjpD) to record, with [PSM 1 Shockmount](http://amzn.to/2FmLcsI) and [PSA1 Swivel Boom Arm](http://amzn.to/2oWtC4M). I use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) for both recording and editing. I try to script the shows as markdown which I edit using Visual Studio Code and then upload to Simplecast to act as the show notes. You can see [my podcasting checklist here](https://ardalis.com/weeklydevtips-podcast-checklist).

The [WeeklyDevTips podcast episodes are also published to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/weeklydevtips?sub_confirmation=1) and occasionally include video with guests or screencasts from my machine.

## XBox

I'm on XBox live as 'ardalis' but haven't had much time to play since late 2020, and before that I'd mainly switched to PC gaming. My go-to game was [PUBG (see one of my better engagements here)](https://youtu.be/8rIctsw98E4). I take breaks from gaming from time to time so I can keep up with all my work and family commitments.
