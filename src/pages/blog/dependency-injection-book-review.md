I like to use an index card as a bookmark when I'm reading non-fiction books, so that I can come back to interesting topics later or review certain points in an article of my own, like this one. Usually one index card is sufficient, but in reading [Dependency Injection: Principles, Practices, and Patterns by Steven von Deursen and Mark Seemann](https://amzn.to/39adnrx)(affiliate link) I filled two front and back. There is a lot of great content packed into this unfortunately-named book. I say unfortunately-named because I agree with one of the quotes on the back cover: 

> Actually three books in one: a really good introduction to DI in .NET, an even better one to DI in general, and an absolutely excellent introduction to OO principles and software design." - Mikkel Arentoft, Danske Bank

Mikkel [buries the lede](https://style.mla.org/dont-bury-the-lede/#:~:text=A%20writer%20%E2%80%9Cburies%20the%20lede,the%20fire%20before%20the%20deaths.) with his comment. This book is first and foremost an excellent guide to writing better software. It achieves this by focusing on the importance of managing dependencies, and because of that, covers different approaches to dependency management, most notably DI.
