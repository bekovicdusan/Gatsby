There is some debate about whether the movie [*Die Hard* (1988)](https://amzn.to/3pdOTDM) should be categorized as a Christmas movie. On the one side are those who point to its central Christmas theme, music, and messaging, all of which add to and in many instances are critical to its plot and theme. On the other side are those who are wrong. Here are a number of reasons why *Die Hard* most certainly should be considered a Christmas movie.

## Popularity

Not only is *Die Hard* a Christmas movie, it's actually the favorite Christmas/holiday season movie in a number of states. According to Hollywood Reporter, *Die Hard* was the most popular movie (relative to other states' searches) in streaming service searches in the states of Washington, Wisconsin, Virginia, and Missouri.

## Its Writer

A few years ago, one of the film's screenwriters, Steven E. de Souza defended *Die Hard* as a Christmas movie, even adding the hash tag #DieHardIsAChristmasMovie. You can [read the exchange on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/944740130681753601).

It's worth noting that at a comedy roast Bruce Willis argued it's not a Christmas movie, it's a Bruce Willis movie, but I think it can certainly be both.

## Essential Christmas Movie Ingredients

Several articles ("listicles") have tried to come up with lists of [essential ingredients](https://screencraft.org/2020/12/04/7-essential-ingredients-to-writing-a-successful-christmas-movie/) or [themes](https://screenwritingmagazine.com/2017/12/25/makes-great-christmas-movie/) of great Christmas movies. No Christmas movie necessarily has them all, but *Die Hard* has its share.

### Family (or missing family)

A central plot element is John McClane's estrangement from his wife and children, the latter figuring heavily into Hans' discovery of Holly's marriage to John.

A big part of the movie is one of John trying to get back together with Holly so they can spend Christmas together with their children. It's a difficult road he has to travel, literally walking across broken glass sometimes, but in the end they're together.

### Romance

While it's certainly not a rom-com, *Die Hard* does have the troubles and eventual reconciliation of the McClanes as a central plot theme. This is most important in the beginning of the film, but it continues through to the very end.

### Nostalgia

Who hasn't wistfully thought back to the days of yore when parents would abandon their children to nannies or what-have-you to spend Christmas Eve of all nights at a (presumably mandatory) corporate party in a downtown skyscraper?

Ok, I'm not sure there's a lot of nostalgia of the holiday-season variety in this movie but I certainly look forward to watching it with my family each year nonetheless. And there's a bit of nostalgia explaining to the younger children how the world worked before smart phones and social media (both of which would have put a big damper on the bad guys' plans in *Die Hard*).

### Trappings of Christmas

Die Hard has plenty of Christmas trappings, from music to decorations and even costumes. It definitely checks the block on this one.

### Redemption

### Magic
